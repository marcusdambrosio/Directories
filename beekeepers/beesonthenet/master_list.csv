Often, there’s little reason to exterminate all the bees in a hive, especially when they can be so valuable for the production of honey or helping pollinate farmers’ crops. We will generally use a bee vacuum or special bee boxes to collect the bees, so they can be transferred to our bee apiary. Call us early enough, we should be able to get the swarm safely moved into a managed hive before they find a place to move into on their own (someone’s walls, and old shed, a hollow tree, birdhouse, etc).

Trapping bees can take up to 8 – 12 weeks and is time consuming for me to check the trapping(s). Cutting down trees to remove bees is something I do but cost is dependent on difficulty of the job. If I feel the removal of the tree is beyond my expertise, you can get an expert to cut the tree down and I will remove the bees. I do not remove the wood but for an additional fee I can limb up the tree. Cutouts are offered for homes and other buildings. Price is determined upon complexity of the job, including height and location. I normally charge a fee to come and look at cutout jobs with part of this fee being returned in the cost of doing the work. I am not responsible for any repairs.
