Blue Lizard Farm,"Offering custom growing and consultations for the hemp industry.
Blue Lizard Farm is in Lincoln County, Nevada, 150 miles north and 2500 feet higher than Las Vegas. It’s a little cooler in the summer and a lot colder in the winter, and probably couldn’t be any more different than what usually springs to mind when people think of “Vegas”. The county is nearly the size of Vermont, but with only 5500 people spread over six towns.
There isn’t a single traffic light in the whole county. It’s the kind of place where, for good or bad, everyone knows everyone. If you’re ever not sure what you’re doing, just ask your neighbor, because they’ll tell you. Kids run around being kids, and people chat in the grocery stores and post offices. There are parades down main street, fundraiser barbecues for the volunteer firemen and the VFW, and Little League games in the parks. It’s a pretty amazing place.
We came to Lincoln County in 2005, after spending six years in Las Vegas doing Africanized bee removal. Rodney is a self-taught beekeeper who began keeping bees in Tucson, AZ in 1992, about the same time Africanized bees became an issue in Southern Arizona. We did bee removal in Tucson for several years, then moved north with the Africanized bees to Las Vegas in 1999.
During our time in Vegas, Rodney had the opportunity to become a beekeeper for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, maintaining research colonies for the Biology Department. It was there that we began to rekindle an interest in agriculture and a desire to get out of the city. When the chance to sell our business and start over on a new adventure appeared, well, we jumped on it and didn’t look back. We bought ten acres of sagebrush, saltbush, tumbleweed, assorted critters, and nothing else. We sunk a well, put in utilities, and set about trying to find a way to support ourselves off a small patch of desert.
And this is where we are today. We’ve got 13 20’×96’ steel-frame hoop houses and a state-inspected packaging facility. For several years, we grew a wide variety of produce, selling to Las Vegas restaurants. In 2017, we switched from growing vegetables to growing hemp which can be used both for its fiber and medicinal purposes. Hemp is a new and growing industry in Nevada, and we are excited to be one of the first Nevada hemp growers.","HC 34 Box 52, Caliente, NV 89008",http://www.bluelizardfarm.com/,christina_mehring@yahoo.com,775-962-2438,hemp
Blustery Bovine,"It all started with visualizing potential.
I’ve always been one to see the good and overlook the bad, whether that be in people or in this case, a foreclosed farm.
“Isn’t it perfect Luke?” I said breathlessly. Choosing to ignore the dead grass, peeling paint, broken fences, half inch of dirt on everything in the house and gigantic mound of tumbleweeds blocking the front door.
When his parents, who have lived in their fair share of rough, ranch houses, came to see it they laughed nervously and said, “If that’s what you want kids, good thing you have a lot of energy!”
But we didn’t care, we had 6 acres of our own!
And Luke has a magic way of making tiny amounts of Nevada water go a long way and the ability to fix or make anything. Soon the grass started to not look so bad!
We started out getting 3 cows to add to our dog.
Then chickens.
Then ducks.
Then sheep.
Then meat chickens.
Then turkeys.
Then a cat.
Then pigs.
Then completely useless peacocks that poop on the porches.
This place was starting to look a bit like a farm.
We loved it all so much, and the meat was so unbelievably good, that we couldn’t just keep it all to ourselves.
So we started a tiny CSA, delivering meat, eggs, produce, and baked goods.
And now we’ve opened a farm store in our garage.
Stay tuned, we’re glad you’re here.
Love,
The Thompsons

Borda Land and Sheep,"The Borda Family has kept the Basque tradition of sheep herding alive in Northern Nevada for more than 100 years. Raymond Borda left the old country in 1912 to herd sheep in the Dayton Valley and started his own sheep business and ranch there in 1921. After first working in other professions, Borda Land and Sheep is now run by third generation family members Joyce Borda Gavin, Angie Borda Page and Ted Borda.  The trio believes it’s important to keep their family’s heritage and tradition alive. Borda Land and Sheep is one of only a few large sheep ranchers still operating in Western Nevada and the only one of Basque heritage.
The family runs about 3,000 Merino/Rambouillet sheep every year and another 3,500 lambs. The wool they produce is considered among the best in the country. The family is also dedicated to providing the best quality meat to American Lamb enthusiasts.
In the springtime, the Borda sheep can often been seen grazing the hillsides of the Sierra Nevada.  Working with local, state and federal agencies, more than 2,000 sheep and lambs graze thousands of acres of land around Carson City and nearby areas to reduce the fire risk.
Lamb lovers can buy Borda lamb at Butcher Boy in Reno. It can also be found on select local restaurant menus.","1422 Ezill Street, Gardnerville, NV 89410",None,None,775-790-0740,"lamb, sheep, wool"

Eagle Valley Farm,"At Eagle Valley Farm, we raise pasture-based beef, chicken, pork, and eggs. Our first commitment is to producing quality meats raised with integrity; our second is to do so sustainably. We strive to be completely transparent in everything we do and encourage our customers to visit us anytime to see how our animals are raised. The farm is managed by Rachel & Casey Sipe on  land that has been farmed by our family for three generations. The land has been in agricultural use since the late 1800s.
Here at Eagle Valley Farm, we are stewards of the land,and we strive to use products that might otherwise be dumped in a landfill. We feed our animals organic fig bars produced in Carson City that were less than perfect for the retail market. We feed bread with expired sales dates from Franco Bakery in Reno. We round out our feeding program with beer mash from local breweries. Utilizing these feeds allows us to keep our prices affordable for our customers.
Our beef cattle are bred from homegrown stock and spend their entire lives on pasture, enjoying the wonderful salad bar nature has to offer. In addition to an unlimited supply of grass (supplemented by hay from our fields in the colder months), our cattle are fed fig bars to create a product with more fat and marbling than strictly grassfed beef.
Our hogs are bred and born on the property where they are kept on deep bedding until they are old enough to go onto pasture. They will then spend the rest of their days roaming our lush pastures, grazing and foraging to their heart’s content. To supplement this diet, they are fed fig bars, bread, and beer mash.
Our meat chickens are kept in portable pens that are moved daily to fresh ground, separating the chickens from yesterday’s waste (making for a healthier environment) and giving them access to fresh grass and insects. They are also fed a mixture of fig bars, bread, and beer mash.
You can find our products at local farmers markets in the summer and at the Bee Keeper in Carson City.","4900 Carson River Rd, Carson City, NV 89701",https://eaglevalleyfarm.square.site/,eaglevalleyfarmnv@gmail.com,775-233-4727,"beef, chicken, eggs, pork"
Estill Ranch – Lani’s Lana Fine Rambouillet Wool,"We are a diversified livestock operation raising cattle, lamb, hay, and, of course – wool.   The Bare Ranch was the first ranch settled in Surprise Valley at  the eastern foot of the Warner Mountain Range.  It was on the route that Peter Lassen scouted for pioneers to travel to California during the Gold Rush. The trade route later became a ranching community.  The Bare Family settled here and the ranch still bears their name. The fourth generation of the Estill Family is now actively involved in the ranch operations.  Lani’s Lana is the dream and creation of Lani Estill who loves wool and is a fiber artist.  The development of a line of yarn was a natural extension of the ranching business and Lani’s love of wool and natural fibers.
Our wool is grown in sustainable, natural methods rooted in tradition with respect for earth, animals, people and the product created for future generation…full circle, natural, with no harmful dyes or chemicals.
Our goal is to offer a product that is produced right here in Northwest Nevada and Northern California, a product that is often only imported from  countries far away.  Although we sell in bulk to companies like Pendleton Woolen Mills, we have an amazing superfine wool that is just so good, that home spinners and fiber artists should be able to access it. too.

Ferrari Farms,"We are a family farm located in urban Reno. Our farm was purchased in 1913 by Dominico and Caterina Ferrari. They were hard workers going from sun up til sun down tilling and working their ground. On November 11, 1920 in their small two-bedroom farmhouse, they had their only son, Frank Sr. He followed in his parents’ footsteps farming the land, dealing with droughts, floods and everything in between. In 1971, Frank married Joanne, a woman who lived across the street from the farm, and less than a year later they had their only child, a son, Frank Jr. Like father, like son –  Frank Jr. carried on the family farm working closely with his father. Over the years they grew many crops including corn, potatoes, onions, squash, and of course, what we are best known for today, PUMPKINS! The produce was harvested and sold to local markets. In 1997, the family decided to set up a small pumpkin patch so that they could share their farm with the local community. As the years went by, the patch grew and new activities were introduced.
Today we have a large corn maze, hayrides, a mechanical bull, fire pits, paintball zombie hunt, bounce house, corn walk, BBQ and over 40 varieties of pumpkins, squash and gourds. We host field trips, birthday parties, graduation parties, corporate events and other group gatherings.
Oh, if Dominico and Caterina could only see what they created when they bought that beautiful little farm along the Truckee River in 1913!

Gilcrease Orchard,"Surprised to see such succulent produce grown in the desert? Thanks to the Gilcrease Family and natural artesian springs, this unique piece of land has been preserved for over 90 years for the community to enjoy.
It all began in 1920 with the arrival of Elda and Leonard Gilcrease and their two sons John Theodore and William Orr. Ted was just a youngster of four and Bill, a baby less than a year old.
Leonard came from a farm family, having been raised at the Gilcrease Ranch in Lemoore, California. He met Elda at the University of Nevada, Reno, where they both graduated with bachelors degrees. After marrying and starting their family, they decided to purchase over 900 acres in the Las Vegas Valley that included natural artisan springs, known as the Lower Tule Springs, for cultivating crops and raising livestock.
Over the years, the Gilcrease Ranch raised chickens and turkeys and sold to the townsfolk and the military base close by. They grew assorted crops including alfalfa and eventually owned more than 1,500 acres of land, cultivating about 200 acres.
Their son Ted showed the greater interest in farming and took over the management of the ranch and land holdings while Bill pursued his interest in art and birds. Nevertheless, they both contributed time and land for the development of the orchard during the 1970s. For over twenty-five years, valley residents enjoyed 100 acres devoted to what Ted called his “pick and pay” orchard.
Recognizing his age and poor health were diminishing his ability to run the orchard, Ted decided he needed to protect the orchard in perpetuity. In 1997 with Bill’s support, he established the nonprofit Gilcrease Orchard Foundation governed by a Board of Trustees.
It was Ted and Bill’s dream that the Gilcrease Orchard would be a place where families could bring their children and enjoy a sampling of the kind of life the brothers knew. They wanted to preserve this unique gem where the community can pick food fresh off the tree or vine and see, feel, and taste the difference. Through their nonprofit foundation, they aimed to provide recreational and educational experiences that teach children where our food comes from and how it is grown, helping to foster an appreciation for the earth’s bounty and a healthy lifestyle.","7810 N.

Happy Bee Farm,"Located in picturesque Crescent Valley, our small farm had its beginning after realizing our small flock of chickens was producing more eggs than we could handle.

We also have a small flock of Indian Runner ducks, which we raise for the rich, delicious eggs. These are wonderful in cookies, cakes and other baking delights! We also have a small flock of White Embden geese which we stumbled upon this spring.
The desire to produce a better quality meal for our family has grown, and in recent months, we have obtained American Guinea Hog cross hogs which will be bred in the coming months, some to replace our herd, with the remainder offered for sale. They are a pasture hog and thrive on a diet of grass and hay, with a small amount of commercial pig feed. They are also smaller in size and quite gentle, making them a perfect fit for a small property such as ours.

Loping Coyote Farms,"Loping Coyote Farms was born in 2008 when owner Nathan’s parents unexpectedly called him to announce that they were ripping out their lawn. They could no longer stomach the absurd amount of water being used every summer to keep their cool season Kentucky blue grass green all the hot summer. Nathan moved back home and, with the help of many wonderful people, began the work of designing and building a permaculture-designed food forest-based farm in his parents’ one-acre backyard.
Almost immediately they jumped into learning how to manage a nursery as part of Loping Coyote Farm because the site needed a lot of plants and because Nathan and his friend Neil tend to push each other’s plant geek button so they couldn’t help but start propagating, which turns out to be an invaluable part of learning plants. They still both work together, along with a great crew of other local people interested in this type of system, in the maintenance of the Loping Coyote Farm site. They also continue to observe and reflect upon and respond to the site with shifting designs and new experimental plantings. Thus far, the steadily evolving and maturing nature of the project, with all the unexpected emergent properties as well as the designed relationships that sometimes actually happen, has been always rich and exciting, even if littered with enlightening failures!","Reno, NV 89506",https://www.lopingcoyotefarms.com/,lopingcoyotefarms@gmail.com,775-686-0008,nursery plants

Mewaldt Organics,"Welcome to Mewaldt Organics! Thanks so much for your support!!!
From Bill and Korena Mewaldt
Sustainable agriculture development is arguably one of the most important endeavors of mankind today.  To that end, we have devoted much of our energy to production of wholesome food and teaching others, through example, how and why sustainable or organic farming methods work.   Bill has a PhD in biology and Korena is a Master Gardener.  Together we match theory with practical knowledge to offer what we believe is the only sensible way to grow food.  Working with nature is always easier and more productive than fighting it.   We challenge all sorts of food crops to our local environment and save the seeds of the successful ones to act as parents of the next generation.
Over the past 25 years we have tested hundreds of varieties of food crops, herbs and flowers for their ability to withstand our harsh, high-desert climate conditions. We save seeds of those which show promise and hopefully improve them by selection for favorable traits.  We were already saving seeds as an integral part of our organic farming operation, so saving extra seeds to sell was an easy adjustment.  You now can get the benefit of our testing and selection.
Saving seeds is an important part of maintaining a sustainable garden or farm.  Once you find open-pollinated varieties that do well in your garden or farm, you are wise to save seeds from the best examples.  Over the years, you will generally find improvements in such things as flavor, disease resistance, vigor and productivity, among many others.  For more information on seed saving, see our store link.
Retail Outlets:  A selection of our seeds is usually available for sale at the Flower Tree Nursery in Fallon and at the Great Basin Community Food Co-Op in Reno.
Produce Outlets:  We market most of our produce through the Great Basin Community Food Co-op in Reno and several upscale restaurants in the Reno.","Fallon, NV 89406",http://www.mewaldtorganics.com/,mewaldtorganics@live.com,775-867-3469,"garlic, nursery plants, seeds, sunchokes, tomatoes"

Montero Goat Farm,"Hi, I’m Gloria Montero, owner of Montero Goat Farm, a lifelong resident of Fallon, Nevada, and I’ve been in the goat business for over 25 years.
The legacy of Montero Goat Farm begins in the early 1920s. My grandfather immigrated to the United States from Portugal. He settled in California where he owned a cow dairy and also kept goats for meat and milk to feed his family. My father was raised with goats and moved to Fallon in 1963. He milked cows by profession and also kept about 60 goats for food and milk and to sell to the public.
While I have grown up around goats my entire life, I didn’t take it up as a profession until 1993. I started with a great herd of registered La Mancha milk goats. In 1998 I bought my first meat goat, a 100% full blood registered Boer buck. From there, I started a breeding program to raise quality, healthy meat goats for the general public and to raise awareness of the health benefits of goat meat.
  I reached out to the local 4-H Club, only to find out that there was no goat program in Fallon! So – I became a 4-H leader and convinced the Nevada Junior Livestock show to allow children to show goats. I also started the goat program here in Fallon. Most recently I have ventured into pack goats and discovered another exciting new world!
  I now have goats in Lovelock grazing on pastures on the Clinger Ranch. Rancher Carl Clinger also has goats, and we work together to provide the consumer with the best quality meat we can. We focus on natural methods of health management; no hormones or steroids are used on our goats. We do not feed or advocate the use of genetically modified feeds. Our goats are grazed on pastures with plenty of fresh air and sunshine.
  Boer Goats are my specialty. I raise goats for meat and dairy and also for pack uses and weed control. What a versatile animal!","PO Box 6392, Fallon, NV 89407",None,goatdiva@yahoo.com,775-427-8210,goat

The purpose for Quail Hollow Farm CSA is fourfold:
One, it is our desire to be good stewards of our land.  Nothing seems more beneficial than to raise wholesome, nutritious food on our farm that we may share with friends and family.
Two, we believe that fresh locally-grown, organic fruits and vegetables are indispensable for optimal nutrition and health.     Three, we have a strong desire for self-sufficiency for our family and for our community.
And, fourth, is simply the joy of the whole gardening process: working the soil (literally being grounded), patiently watching the growing process, the taste of the first ripe tomato, and the harmony of the seasons.
In addition, it is our desire to share this experience with others, offering enjoyable hands-on opportunities to learn the science and skill of gardening and preserving the harvest.
We look forward to sharing a wonderful harvest season with you!

Getting started wasn’t easy. Nearly fifty volunteers from around the community stepped up to help prepare the facility for the first growing season. The ongoing contributions of time and expertise from our volunteer network keep the facility running. Thank you volunteers!
Currently, the RHNI is growing fresh fruits and vegetables for HCC’s three food pantries, farmers markets, and local restaurants and distributors. Future plans for RHNI include a commercial kitchen, vegetable nursery, community garden, cooking workshops, food demos, youth internship opportunities, and a summer workstudy program.
